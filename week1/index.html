                    Hello! My name is Kieran and I am a senior at Michigan State University. 
                    I am studying Computer Science and hope to receive my degree this spring.
                    I have four other siblings who are all within five years age of me. I grew 
                    up north in Travserse City and didn't realize how popular my hometown is until I came to college.

                <div>
                    I really enjoy sports and exercise. I currently play on six IM sports teams including Soccer, Football,
                    Ultimate Frisbee, and Pickleball. I also enjoy going for runs in the early morning or evening when it
                    is cooler.
